// The trust boundary this package exists to guard: an inbound HTTP
// call from a network Workbench does not control. Every byte off the
// wire is untrusted until its signature verifies against the
// trigger's own secret, over a delivery recent enough to matter.
//
// Security-model note: the secret is generated server-side with
// `crypto.randomBytes` and shown to the caller exactly once, at
// creation or rotation. `store.ts` encrypts it at rest through
// Interchange's `CredentialCipher` seam (`@intx/types`), closing the
// "database dump discloses every signing secret" half of this
// tradeoff — but this function still needs the *raw* secret in process
// memory to recompute the HMAC, and `store.ts` decrypts it back to
// plaintext for exactly that purpose on every `get`/`getById`. That
// half of the tradeoff is inherent to HMAC verification (unlike a
// hashed password, the verifying side must be able to reproduce the
// MAC, not just compare against it) and is not something
// `CredentialCipher` — an at-rest seam — removes; closing it for real
// means moving to asymmetric signing (caller signs with a private key,
// this package verifies with a stored public key), a bigger v2 change.
// Flagged, not silently accepted.
//
// The other half of that same tradeoff — one shared secret, verified
// by recomputing the same MAC, with nothing to stop a captured
// request from being replayed forever — is closed here by binding an
// `X-Webhook-Timestamp` into the signed material instead of signing
// `rawBody` alone. `verifySignature` rejects a delivery whose
// timestamp falls outside a 5-minute window on either side of now —
// both a stale replay of an old capture and a timestamp forged far
// into the future — the same window Stripe's `timestamp.signature`
// scheme uses. This still doesn't stop a delivery replayed within
// that window; closing that fully needs a tracked, per-delivery nonce
// (a bigger v2 change, like the asymmetric-signing one above).
