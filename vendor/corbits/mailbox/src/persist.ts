// The transport dual-write seam. Two edge cases live here and nowhere else:
// sender authorization, and dual-write independence (an upstream throw still
// attempts the mailbox write).
//
// Both are properties of ONE wrapper: a host's mail transport already persists
// its own record of a frame (the sender's outbound copy, agent-instance
// deliveries), and this package additionally lands a durable inbound row in
// every addressed principal's mailbox. Two writes, two owners, and the whole
// point is that neither can take the other down.
//
// The "active instance only" predicate itself is NOT implementable here and is
// not ours to implement: deciding whether a sender address belongs to a live
// agent instance is the host's call, not a schema fact. So it is a seam —
// `authorizeSender` — and the *enforcement* is ours: a sender the host declines
// to authorize gets NO mailbox row, while the frame is still delegated upstream
// exactly as it would have been.
