 * existence check and the pg_type insert are not atomic — so the lock, not the
 * IF NOT EXISTS, is what makes this safe.
 *
 * Each applied migration is recorded with a checksum of its statements. A
 * shipped migration that is later edited fails loudly here instead of leaving
 * already-migrated environments silently behind fresh ones.
 *
 * The run also lowers `client_min_messages` to `warning` for the duration of
 * the transaction. Every DDL statement here is deliberately `IF NOT EXISTS`,
 * and on the second and every later boot Postgres answers each one with a
 * NOTICE (`relation "…" already exists, skipping`). postgres.js has no notice
 * handler by default, so it dumps the raw notice OBJECT to the console —
 * meaning a perfectly clean re-boot of a runner documented as "safe to call on
 * every boot" printed a wall of what looked like errors on every replica start.
 * `SET LOCAL` scopes the change to this transaction and stops at NOTICE:
 * WARNING and above still reach the host untouched. It is set on the connection
 * rather than via a client option so it holds for ANY handle a host hands in,
 * including one this package did not construct.
 *
 * Each migration applies inside its own nested transaction (a savepoint under
 * the outer one), so a migration is all-or-nothing with its ledger row and can
 * never be recorded as applied with only some of its statements run. With one
 * migration this is equivalent to the flat form; the moment a second lands it
 * stops being equivalent, and a runner that rolls back inconsistently is not
 * something to discover then.
